# Unity-MonkeyBall
**Project Version:** 1.0.0

**ML-agents Version:** 0.14

**Python Version:** 3.8

### Welcome!
Unity Monkey Ball is a Reinforcement Learning Project made for academic purposes, focused on training agents in environments that look like classic MonkeyBall levels. Of course, it's made in Unity and physics are a whole different thing, but it is not intended to be an outright copy of the game, so that's alright!

There will be further updates on this issue, but for now, these are the folders that should be brought to your attention:

- *Assests, Packages & Project Settings:* Unity shenanigans. These contain all of the project files.
- *models:* Contains the generated models for the different agent's iterations, as well as their corresponding neural networks.
- *summaries:* Training-related information. As for a guide on how to extract and view this information with Tensorboard, there is a very good reference [here](https://github.com/gzrjzcx/ML-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-ML-Agents.md).
